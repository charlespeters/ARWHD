“Work hard. Don’t be an a**hole. Share what you know.” &mdash; Brad Frost

I struggle with design and development and communicating. Being a designer is a balancing act of all those things. And those are the things that are agreed to be the way to be successful over time in the web industry.

So I made this site.

As I struggle I often miss the mark; aiming but not always making contact. I thought the best way to move forward was to share the mistakes and the successes, to have them set alongside the good ideas, best practices and summations of what I know.

Design, User Experience, Front-end Development are all complicated in their own way. I want to put some order to those subjects for myself and hopefully benefit any reader.

### Goals

My only real goals here are to make sense of things like design & front-end code and to write about the things that fill my time: the work & business of web design. I ultimately, just want to get better at client services and at front-end development.

### Colophon

This site is powered by Jekyll. It’s made with Sass, Autoprefixer, Gulp & Flexbox, Prism.js, Vanilla-FitVids & written mostly with the Atom editor. It’s version controlled with Github and hosted on Github Pages.

The typeface being used is Whitney from Hoefler & Co.

### About Me

My name is Charles. I’m a designer. I work for [Black Pixel](https://blackpixel.com/) and if you ever want me to shut up for about 20 minutes, put Chinese food in front of me.

<s>Please be advised that I don’t have any patience for a**holes that aren’t me and I am not often concerned with IE8 support.</s> I closed comments.
