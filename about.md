“Work hard. Don’t be an a**hole. Share what you know.” &mdash; Brad Frost

I struggle with client work, being a freelancer and being a web designer. It’s a balancing act of business, account management and the work itself. But those three things are agreed to be the way to be successful over time in the web industry.

So I made this site.

As I struggle through working I find myself, missing the mark, aiming but not always making contact. I thought the best way to move forward was to share the mistakes and the successes, to have them set alongside the good ideas, best practices and summations of what I know.

Design, User Experience, Front-end Development are all complicated in their own way. I want to put some order to those subjects for myself and hopefully benefit any reader.

### Goals

My only real goals here are to make sense of things like design & front-end code and to write about the things that fill my time: the work & business of web design. I ultimately, want to get better at client services and better at front-end development.

### Colophon

This site is somewhat reluctantly powered by Jekyll. It’s made with SASS, Autoprefixer, Grunt & Flexbox, Prism.js, FitText/FitVids & written mostly with the Atom editor (Beta). It’s hosted on Github Pages, version controlled with Github (via Tower).

The typefaces being used are Proxima Nova & Proxima Nova Condensed by Mark Simonson served via Typekit.

Please be advised that I don’t have any patience for a**holes that aren’t me and I am not often concerned with IE8 support.
