I'm available for hire as a web designer &amp; front-end developer (and illustrator). Typically I work with small businesses, individuals, agencies and myself, but I would love the challenge of doing something new.


### Want to Hire Me?

All you need to do is [email me](mailto:charlespeters42@gmail.com?Subject=Work%20Inquiry%20from%20ARWHD) with all the details of your project. The more you tell me about it the better. A few things to definitely include:

- What You're Hiring Me to Do
- Budget
- Timeline
- Who You Are
- Information about the Project
- About your Company/Organization

I'm going to need information about all those things eventually and it's best to start with them. I'd love to be able to help you build something awesome.
