        <p>As I struggle through working as a web designer, I find myself, missing the mark, aiming but not always making contact. I thought the best way to move forward was to share the mistakes and the successes, to have them set alongside the good ideas, best practices and summations of what I know.</p>
        <p>This site is meant to be a good place to discuss those things like Design, User Experience, Front-end Development and Client Services, that I find challenging and make some sense of them.</p>

                    <p>I am a huge Grunt user, it's pretty essential to my build process. I've collected my boilerplate of tasks &amp; configurations I use on every project I work on. For SASS after it compiles and I then run Autoprefixer, a minifier. Then linting &amp; uglify for JavaScript, watch and a notify task that has OS X stuff.</p>

                    <p>This is a blank Wordpress theme to help me speed through Wordpress projects. It's meant solely to pull in everything like your own markup, stylesheets and scripts.</p>
