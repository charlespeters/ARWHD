				<h2>The Web is Complicated</h2>
			</header>
			<p>As I struggle through working as a web designer, I find myself, missing the mark, aiming but not always making contact. I thought the best way to move forward was to share the mistakes and the successes, to have them set alongside the good ideas, best practices and summations of what I know.</p>
			<p>This site is meant to a good place to discuss those things like Design, User Experience, Front-end Development and Client Services, that I find challenging and make some sense of them.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://github.com/charlespeters/Grunt.js-Boilerplate">Grunt Boilerplate →</a></h3>
			<p>I am a huge Grunt user, it's pretty essential to my build process. I've collected my boilerplate of tasks &amp; configurations I use on every project I work on. For SASS after it compiles and I then run Autoprefixer, a minifier. Then linting &amp; uglify for JavaScript, watch and a notify task that has OS X stuff.</p>
