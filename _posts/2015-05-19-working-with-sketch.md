We have a problem with graphics editors. There hasn’t really been an intentional application for designing user interfaces in really ever. Adobe keeps trying to make Photoshop for the web and for UI design and it keeps coming up short for me and probably for a lot of other people. But remember, Photoshop is like 25 years old. And Photoshop is a photo editing software, layout, typography is an after thought and lot of things you’re looking for are hidden or in layer styles.

So let's face it, Photoshop has a big learning curve (or at least for me it did) and it has a really high cognitive overhead. The value of a tool is for it to get out of your way while you work and aid you in the task at hand. If Photoshop can't do that, it's time to find another tool.

If you’ve spent any time on Designer News or worse in the comments of Designer News, you know what Sketch wants to be the king of the hill for UI design. It’s supposed to be this magic bullet of UI design tools and I feel like it really has the potential to be that.

### Me & Sketch

As to me I was pretty tired of Photoshop. I was working with a few guys who included all the details about interaction in Photoshop notes in this pixel-perfect mockup. And the mockups themselves didn’t help us make responsive designs or patterns. I was so exhausted with that type of non-reality. So I went to Sketch as an alternative to Photoshop mostly for that reason.

I loved that I didn’t really need to watch any tutorials to feel productive in Sketch. After fumbling with it and remembering it wasn’t another Adobe product and that muscle memory started to wear-off a little bit, it felt like the thing I need to compliment working in the browser.

I mostly work in CSS (via preprocessor) and design mostly in the browser. I have a pretty nice workflow for doing that and even more so I always feel like I'm designing with more context in the browser. But sometimes I still need to use a graphics editor to work with color
