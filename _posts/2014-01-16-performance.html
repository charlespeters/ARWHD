<p class="lede">Designers need to care about performance. It’s a huge contributing factor to user experience and a main cause of higher bounce rates. <a href="http://www.speedawarenessmonth.com/when-8020-becomes-2080/">80% of page load time</a> is due to the front-end: images, web fonts, scripts, stylesheets.</p>
<p>Without a clear way to detect bandwidth on a device, there’s no real way to tell which users have adequate bandwidth to receive every byte of richness we’d like to share with them. And having to <a href="http://www.charlespeters.net/focusing/">focus</a> with smaller screens makes us consider performance as a design element versus a development concern.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Performance matters.</p>
<p>There are 4 generally agreed upon methods of boosting a website’s performance. I won’t go into specific best practices for these methods since that’s done by smarter people than me, but all the information below should give you a good idea to know where to go.</p>
<h3>Gzip Your Assets</h3>
<p>When you’re requesting a website’s files from a server you can batch them all at once with Gzipping. It creates something like a zip file to send back to the browser to uncompress. By doing this, the file being requested is smaller saving bandwidth and download time.</p>
<p>Full instructions <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/htaccess/active-gzip-compression/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Concatenate and Minify Your Stylesheets &amp; Scripts</h3>
<p>Minifying is really straight forward. CSS and JavaScript are both indifferent to whitespace that isn’t in a string. So each time you add tabs or spaces in your document, you’re making it larger. That’s not bad in development, but on your production site it’s best to minify those files and make them smaller.</p>
<p>When I think of concatenating files, I think of stitching a patchwork quilt of all your different script &amp; stylesheet files. It’s easy enough to do in Codekit or Grunt.js, that way you’re serving a single global Javascript file and a single stylesheet. If you’re preprocessing your CSS you can just import all your files into a single file.</p>
<h3>Choose a Responsive Images Solution</h3>
<p>You likely aren’t going to want send a 1000px wide file to a mobile device. You probably aren’t going to want to send a lo-resolution to a 27 inch display.</p>
<p>There are tons of solutions out there, each with their advantages and complications to each one. <a href="http://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a> gives us a pretty good run down here:</p>

<h3>Reducing your Number of HTTP Requests Data URIs</h3>
<p>To me personally, this one is obvious: reduce the number requests your site makes. The less trips you make to the server the better. So you need to ask things like how many images and fonts do you really need? Can you use an icon font? Is there a need for all the media on your page?</p>
<p>Data URIs are data that the browser can use to display an image. It uses a really long string of text. It’s what you’d get when you open an image in a text editor. The big sell here is that it saves an HTTP request. I find that it’s perfect for background textures, logos, any really small image file. Here’s a really <a href="http://jpillora.com/base64-encoder/">simple drag and drop generator</a>.</p>

<p>Making a website more performant doesn’t need to be complicated. The steps I outlined here were, in the main, pretty simple. If you have a technique you use to make your website faster, share below in the comments section.</p>
