[Editorially](editorially.com) is by far one of my favorite tools to work with on the whole internet. I’ll even go so far as to say its public beta was the catalyst to get me writing again.

I’ll explain; what we have here is a perfect storm. Editorially was made by a few people I very much admire and whose brains I would like to pick. Namely, [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com/), who is a one man [web typography](http://vimeo.com/34178417) machine, [Ethan Marcotte](http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/), the dude who responds to all the webs or something like that &amp; [Mandy Brown](http://aworkinglibrary.com/), who corrals all my favorite authors at [A Book Apart](http://www.abookapart.com/).

Editorially is like version control for writing. You can invite collaborators to read and edit and create new versions based on your revisions. The best part is being able to roll back to previous versions and compare them.

For me, it gives the ability to write a draft, invite [Sabrina](https://twitter.com/sabrinadpeters) to it and let her proofread it. It’s a great system. I go make dinner, she makes edits. Perfect, right?

### Current Workflow

I’ll start outlining a blog post in a list on Editorially, wait a day and come back to it. When Sabrina makes her notes, I go back, revise and get a final proofread of the piece. Each of these iterations can be marked for each stage they’re in so everyone sharing the document can see the progress at a glance.

From there (after my wife gives me the thumbs up), I need to publish it. Editorially allows you to export to a Jetpack powered Wordpress site or add to Dropbox. I prefer sending my documents to Wordpress so I can go in and publish them to this site.

My one caveat about this is that you can only export to posts in Wordpress, and not the other media types like pages or [custom post types](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Types). The work around I found is this plugin, [Post Type Switcher](http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher/). It allows you to change a post to a custom post type or a page.

And really, Editorially shouldn’t have to integrate every possibility and nuance of your setup; there’s no telling what amount of custom post types you have or what you have in your configuration. Plus, I don’t think Jetpack’s API allows you to parse that type of information (I’m not really sure). Bottom line is, when you’re writing content for your Wordpress site and you need to do more than one post, it’s not a deal-breaker.

This current workflow makes it really nice to abstract the writing from the blog itself. It helps me not to worry about every configuration in Wordpress or settings. It’s a nice workflow that makes me write more.

## Markdown

Writing in Editorially is done in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It’s a little bit of a learning curve but they have a handy cheat sheet and [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) has some great documentation on the subject.

### Features I’d Like to See

The more time I spend writing in Editorially, the more I’d like to see it grow and develop. As it is, it’s an amazing service and it’s completely responsive and available in most places you need to write.

However, I’d like to see a few things to make it better.

I would like the ability to connect multiple Wordpress blogs &amp; to automatically publish your work. This could be an amazing feature that would make team-writing for small publications amazing, and would keep people who don’t need to be messing in the Wordpress Dashboard out of there.

The one thing about any awesome tool on the internet is an ability to access everything else on the internet. So, maybe some distraction-free writing tools could be added. I’m not entirely sure how those tools would look &amp; work from browser to browser. Maybe if it could automatically lock into Chrome’s Presentation Mode or maybe if you answer the wizard’s three riddles he’ll give you some magical Javascript solution. I’m not sure, but I think it’s worth the time to investigate.

One of the other major things I’d like to see different, or maybe even a blog post about, is their typography. I’m genuinely curious as to why they chose Facit over something like Tisa Web or another of Typekit’s wonderful fonts. Plus, why aren’t the fonts anti-aliased? Again, it’s not so much a complaint as a curiosity.

### Wrap Up

If you do any writing, or publish with Wordpress at all, you need Editorially. The collaboration tools are incredible, and gives you some abstraction from Wordpress as you’re writing. And if it didn’t change at all, I would still use it constantly.
