I don't like MAMP. I don't think I need to qualify that statement at all. For development, Rails comes with it's own server, there's a great connect task for both Grunt & Gulp and [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com/) fills in the other gaps for the static web server. But having a good server for PHP, particularily Wordpress, isn't as straightforward (at least from my perspective).

### Getting Going

Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) &amp; [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Clone the [VVV repo](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)

Run `vagrant up`

Fuck it, I'm done `vagrant destroy`
