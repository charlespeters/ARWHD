As a front-end developer that's lots of little things you need to do as a part of your workflow, like compiling your SASS files, running [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer), minifying your SVG files, optimizing your images, linting your Javascript files, firing up a server.

Naturally a tool would come along to simplify and automate some of those that processes. There's a few major tools on the market, namely Codekit, Grunt & Gulp.

### Codekit
The first Codekit is how I got interested in using SASS on my projects and made me an instant convert. Style injection, live reloading, Bower components and now ports a local server from MAMP that's accessible on all devices.

The second offering of Codekit is even more amazing than the first.

It's lacking in the way of customization.

### Grunt.js

Grunt configuration, it little harder but




### Gulp.js
I'm not really into Gulp yet. Based on this [talk from Mark Dalgleish](http://markdalgleish.github.io/presentation-build-wars-gulp-vs-grunt/), I should and will love it but it needs to mature more. It is definitely on my radar though.
