Flexbox is one of those things you either hate and dismiss or want to embrace and use on every project. Flexbox is a layout module for CSS. It's a way to layout elements on a line based on unknown dimensions and have the inner boxes become flexible to it's outer container.

It's absolutely wonderful. Here's the rundown:
- You don't have to clear a row of columns.
- Columns can be reordered.

This is going to be our demo we're going to work with:

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="4981" data-slug-hash="iEyfG" data-default-tab="result" data-user="charlespeters" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/charlespeters/pen/iEyfG/'>Flexbox Demo</a> by charles peters (<a href='http://codepen.io/charlespeters'>@charlespeters</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

### Flex Container

You need to start by declaring `display: flex`, that will make the immediate children in that container element flex children. So far that's all we need to do.


### Flex Children

Now a flex child needs a few attributes.

<pre><code class="language-css">flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css">flex: 1;</code></pre>

### Flex Wrap


### You Can Even Freaking Nest It

So, because there are still things on the planet, you can nest flexbox inside of flexbox.
