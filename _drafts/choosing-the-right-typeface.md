There’s two really distinct fundamental functions for typography on the web: body type and headlines. They have different roles and create a barebones hierarchy for your design. I wanna talk about leveraging the most use and best practice out of each of them.

Generally speaking, It’s easier to read geometric and humanist sans serif typefaces on the web. With the way pixels get rendered on different machines (particularly the difference between Windows &amp; Mac) and the type of resolution that are associated with those screens can be a really wild gambit. Your best move is to use a typeface that has nice round features like Preston, Freight Sans, Museo, Proxima Nova (which I personally love a lot) or Soleil. They can really attract a lot of visual interest because they’re well designed faces that are highly legible and scale really well into small and large sizes.

Serif fonts can be great but I haven’t come across a great number of them that I’ve felt really bring out a lot leverage in a design, but that’s mostly a personal preference. There are some really interesting serif typefaces for the web namely: Tisa, Skolar, Athelas &amp; Chaparral. Even really notable oldstyle serifs like Garamond, look amazing on the web, despite the fact the designer likely never imagined that his typeface would ever not be printed on a page.

Great type for text generally has low contrast and a high x-height in a regular/book weight, while headline type does better with fonts that are bold with higher contrast. And despite what you might think, Helvetica is really terrible for this; it has a really poor spacing and exceptionally low amounts of contrast in the strokes, plus the counters are really tight; all of that makes it really hard to distinguish in small sizes.

Also it’s worth noting that you shouldn’t ignore Georgia, Verdana or Lucida Grande because they’re defaults. They were designed by really amazing type designers specifically for the screen. Georgia looks amazing on any screen and Verdana has a lot good distinction between characters makes it really ideal in running type.

There a lot resources to get free web fonts to put on your site. You will get what you pay for, there’s a lot of trash, a lot really inappropriate typefaces for the web and really sloppy student work. There are few treasures, a few free typefaces that come to mind that are actually great for the web: [Open Sans](http://opensans.com/), [Source Sans](http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?event=displayFontPackage&amp;amp;code=1959), [Charter](http://practicaltypography.com/charter.html), [Fira Sans](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/), [Merriweather](http://sorkintype.com/fonts.html), [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/) &amp; [Aleo](https://www.behance.net/gallery/ALEO-Free-Font-Family/8018673).
